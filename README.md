# scatterplot

Steps to run:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to the directory "scatterplot" 
3. Do "yarn install" to install all the dependencies.
4. Do "yarn start" to run the development server, which will open the application on "localhost:3000"


Implementation: 

1. Used the line-chart node module from chartjs & customised it to behave like a scatter chart.
2. Customised the input data object to work in-line with the line-chart's data model.
